This project contains several Python scripts for working with comma-separated
(CSV) data files. They were originally developed to help with analyzing test
results coming from Grinder_ and Performance Monitor.

All of the scripts require Python_. The ``csvgraph.py`` script also depends on
matplotlib_ and NumPy_.

If you'd like to stay up to date with the latest version of this project
folder, install Bazaar_ and check out a copy to your local disk::

    cd \some\local\path
    bzr branch lp:csvsee

Then use ``bzr update`` to stay current with the latest version.
