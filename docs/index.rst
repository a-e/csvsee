   contain the root `toctree` directive.

CSVSee
======

You are reading the documentation for CSVSee_, a tool for manipulating and
visualizing data in comma-separated (CSV) files.

.. _CSVSee: http://www.automation-excellence.com/software/csvsee


Motivation
----------
This tool was originally developed to help with analyzing test results coming
from Grinder_ and Performance Monitor. It was partly inspired by `Grinder
Analyzer`_, which serves a similar purpose in a more specific domain.

.. _Grinder: http://grinder.sourceforge.net/
.. _Grinder Analyzer: http://track.sourceforge.net/

Features
--------
* Generate graphs of just about any numerical data, particularly those having timestamps
* Match one or more CSV column names with regular expressions
* Plot the top ``N`` data sets, by average or peak value within each column
* Automatic color-coding when graphing multiple columns
* Display graphs in an interactive viewer with zooming/panning capability
* Export graphs to a ``.png``, ``.svg`` or ``.pdf`` file
* Customizable line styles, title / axis labels, and timestamp formats
* Automatic guessing of date/time format

Installation
------------
If you want to install an official release, first download one from the
`downloads page`_, and extract it somewhere.

Then, open that directory in a terminal and run::

    sudo python setup.py install

Or use pip_::

    sudo pip install .

One advantage of using ``pip`` is that you can uninstall later like so::

    sudo pip uninstall CSVSee

If you'd rather use a copy of the latest development version, branch it using
Bazaar_::

    bzr branch lp:csvsee

then install as before using ``setup.py`` or ``pip``.

Python_ is required. The ``graph`` command also depends on matplotlib_ and
NumPy_.
